The objective of this experiment is to illustrate the concept of perceptron learning in the context of pattern classification task. Following are the goals of the experiment:
- To demonstrate the perceptron learning law.
- To illustrate the convergence of the weights for linearly separable classes.
- To observe the behaviour of the neural network for two classes which are not linearly separable.
